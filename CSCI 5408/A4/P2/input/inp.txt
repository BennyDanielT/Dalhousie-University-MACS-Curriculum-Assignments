Tweets are the basic building block of all things Twitter. The Tweet object has a long list of ‘root-level’ fields, such as id, text, and created_at. Tweet objects are also the ‘parent’ object to several child objects including user, media, poll, and place. Use the field parameter tweet.fields when requesting these root-level fields on the Tweet object.

The Tweet object that can be found and expanded in the user resource. Additional Tweets related to the requested Tweet can also be found and expanded in the Tweet resource. The object is available for expansion with ?expansions=pinned_tweet_id in the user resource or ?expansions=referenced_tweets.id in the Tweet resource to get the object with only default fields. Use the expansion with the field parameter: tweet.fields when requesting additional fields to complete the object.
